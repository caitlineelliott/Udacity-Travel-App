### NextTrek Travel App
An app that uses user data and multiple APIs to help users plan trips.

## Languages
* HTML
* CSS/Sass
* JavaScript

## Project Description
"You will be building a travel application. It’s common to pull basic data from an API, but many applications don’t just pull the weather, they pull in multiple types of data, from different sources and occasionally one API will be required to get data from another API.

The project will include a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. The OpenWeather API is fantastic but it doesn’t let you get future data for free and it’s not that flexible with what information you enter; we are going to use the Weatherbit API for you to see how another API accomplishes the same goals. Weatherbit API has one problem, it only takes in coordinates for weather data -- it’s that specific. So, we’ll need to get those coordinates from the Geonames API. Once we have all of this data, we’ll want to display an image of the location entered; for this, we will be using the Pixabay API."

## Additional Functionality I Added
* Add end date and display length of trip.
* Allow the user to remove the trip.
* Allow user to edit the trip dates
* Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.
* Incorporate icons into forecast.
* Allow the user to add a todo list and/or packing list for their trip.
* Allow the user to add additional trips (this may take some heavy reworking, but is worth the challenge).
* Automatically sort additional trips by countdown.
